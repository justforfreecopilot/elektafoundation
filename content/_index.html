<h2>Our initial focus will be Africa</h2>
<p class="lead">Elekta Foundation will focus its initial efforts on the African countries of Kenya, Senegal and Rwanda, focusing on three key areas to improve cancer care access in these low- and middle-income countries: education and training, cancer care infrastructure and awareness and prevention.</p>
<p>This pilot phase will then allow us to expand Foundation initiatives in surrounding countries, regions and – as quickly as possible – the rest of the world.</p>
