					<h3>Turkish Society for Radiation Oncology (TROD)</h3>

					<p>The Turkish Society for Radiation Oncology (TROD) was founded in 1993, though the history of radiotherapy in Turkey goes back to the end of the 19th century. As in the case of several countries in the world, radiation oncology units were located within the Radiology departments, and all radiotherapy treatments were performed by radiologists in Turkey until the 1990’s.</p>

					<p>The foundation of our Society and the separation of radiation oncology discipline from radiology resulted in the rapid advancement of radiotherapy infrastructure and human resources in Turkey. With over 1000 members, TROD  is currently one of the most powerful and influential societies within the central Eurasian region. Turkey has over 150 radiotherapy centers with high tech machines including several MR Linac units and with the ability to use advanced radiotherapy techniques.</p>

					<p>TROD recently signed several educational collaboration MOUs with Elekta, Meditel, Pakistanian Society for Radiation Oncology, Albanian Oncology Association, Slovakian Radiation Oncology, Advanced Integrated Cancer Foundation in Egypt. We are providing online or face to face educational and training activities in the TIMEA region (Turkey, India, Middle East, Africa), Middle Asia, Romania, Ukraine, Balkan region within the context of those MOUs. In the near future, TROD will expand current coverage to Far East Asia, Australia, and Japan.</p>

					<p>TROD is also a member of ESTRO. TROD Presidents and board members are active in several international organizations or subcommittees of IAEA, ASTRO and ESTRO.</p>

					<p>TROD’s motto is radiating science & radiant future with our vision of equal and fair cancer care for all.</p>

					<p>Rayos Contra Cancer (RCC) is a non profit organization that promotes sustainable access to high quality, timely, and affordable radiation treatment for cancer in limited - resource settings globally.</p>

					<p>RCC organizes education and training programs for Radiotherapy professionals in areas where such training is otherwise scarce. The training programs are developed and taught by expert volunteers  who have a passion for sharing their radiotherapy expertise with other clinicians. RCC partners with radiotherapy clinics that are already operating and empowers their clinicians to provide the best possible patient care.</p>

					<p>RCC has provided training to cancer clinics in over 60 countries across Latin America, Africa, Middle East, and Asia.</p>

					<p>“Rayos Contra Cancer” means “Rays Against Cancer” in Spanish, and past training programs have been offered in English, Spanish, Arabic, and French. RCC’s programs cover best practices in 3D External Beam Radiotherapy, IMRT, SBRT/SRS, and HDR Brachytherapy.</p>

					<p>Over 2000 radiotherapy professionals around the world have participated in RCC programs, representing a range of roles including Radiation Oncologists, Medical Physicists, Dosimetrists, and Radiation Therapists. To make the programs widely accessible, RCC leverages technology to provide remote training.</p>
