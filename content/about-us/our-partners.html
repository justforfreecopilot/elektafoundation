					<h3>Turkish Society for Radiation Oncology (TROD)</h3>

					<p>The Turkish Society for Radiation Oncology (TROD) was founded in 1993. With over 1000 members, TROD is currently one of the most powerful and influential oncology societies within the central Eurasian region. Turkey has over 150 radiotherapy centers with high tech machines including several MR Linac units and with the ability to use advanced radiotherapy techniques.</p>

					<p>TROD recently signed several educational collaboration MOUs with Elekta and the Elekta Foundation. TROD provides online or face to face educational and training activities in the TIMEA region (Turkey, India, Middle East, Africa), Middle Asia, Romania, Ukraine and the Balkan region.

					<h3>Rayos Contra Cancer</h3>

					<p>Rayos Contra Cancer (RCC) means "Rays Against Cancer" in Spanish. It is a non-profit organization that promotes sustainable access to high quality, timely, and affordable radiation treatment for cancer in limited resource settings globally.</p>

					<p>RCC organizes education and training programs for radiotherapy professionals in areas where such training is scarce. The training programs are developed and conducted by expert volunteers who have a passion for sharing their radiotherapy expertise with other clinicians. RCC partners with radiotherapy clinics that are already operating and empowers their clinicians to provide the best possible patient care.</p>

					<p>RCC has provided training to cancer clinics in over 60 countries across Latin America, Africa, Middle East, and Asia. Training programs are offered in English, Spanish, Arabic, and French. RCC's programs cover best practices in 3D External Beam Radiotherapy, IMRT, SBRT/SRS, and HDR Brachytherapy.</p>

					<p>Over 2000 radiotherapy professionals around the world have participated in RCC programs, representing a range of roles including Radiation Oncologists, Medical Physicists, Dosimetrists, and Radiation Therapists. To make the programs widely accessible, RCC provides remote training.</p>
