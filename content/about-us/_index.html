				<p>We know that cancer is the second largest cause of death, growing twice as fast as other diseases. This is accentuated in regions around the world that have little access to cancer technology. There is a strong correlation between regions with high cancer cases and those that have low access to the best cancer treatment technology and training. Global cancer incidences are growing at 2% per year with more than half of all new cases coming from Emerging Markets (Source: GLOBOCAN 2020) Approximately 70% of deaths from cancer occur in low- and middle-income countries” WHO 2018r6tfy7ighrvh0uwG</p>

				<p>Elekta Foundation’s structure enables a wider engagement to strengthen cancer care in low- and middle-income markets ​by harnessing philanthropic and voluntary engagement. It allows for extended partnerships and collaborations with NGOs, foundations, governments and academic partners to achieve accessible cancer treatment for all.</p>

				<p>This also reflects a core priority within Elekta’s sustainability program.</p>

				<p>We know that RT plays a vital role in cancer care, but access is still limited in many parts of the world. 50% of all patients will benefit from it but only 30% can access it: 75% of global RT equipment serves only 25% of the market demand (DIRAC and UN population).</p>
				<p>Over 50-60% of cancer patients will require radiation therapy as part of their treatment; however, in the developing countries, less than 20% of cancer patients will have access to radiotherapy. Developing countries account for 85% of world’s population, but only account for 35% of world’s radiation facilities. (Global Health Initiative Subcommittee (ARRO)).</p>

				<p>There are fewer radiotherapists and cancer healthcare professionals in these regions. Elekta Foundation hopes to attract, train and nurture new via vocational educational programs that augment an individual's existing healthcare training to provide world class cancer treatment.</p>

				<p>Elekta Foundation believes that everyone should have access to the best cancer treatment, technology and training.</p>

				<p>Elekta Foundation will initially focus on 3 areas of Africa: Kenya, Rwanda and Senegal where growing populations, a lack of prevention awareness and poor access to radiotherapy inhibits cancer treatment. Economic stability in these areas prevents effective educational programmes from being possible.</p>

				<p>This supports Elekta’s 2025 strategy of granting access to RT to 300m more people in low- and middle-income markets via 800 to 1000 additional Elekta Linacs</p>
