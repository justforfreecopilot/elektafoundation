				<h2>A growing cancer burden</h2>
				<p>Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 10 million deaths in 2021, nearly one in six deaths. Cancer-causing infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis, are responsible for approximately 30% of cancer cases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated weaknesses in health systems, and many countries report that cancer screening and treatment have been partially or completely disrupted since 2020.</p>

				<h2>Access to treatment</h2>

				<p>Many cancers can be cured if detected early and treated effectively but cancer care reflects the inequalities of our world. Treatment is available in more than 90% of high-income countries but in less than 15% of low-income countries.</p>

				<p>Despite being a critical component of cancer treatment, access to radiotherapy is still inadequate, particularly in low-income countries. The situation is particularly acute in Africa where nearly 70% of the countries report not having access to radiotherapy.</p>
