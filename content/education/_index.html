				<h2>Training and Education in Radiotherapy</h2>

				<p>In radiotherapy, patient outcomes depend on how clinicians use their equipment and techniques.
					Unfortunately, there is a large knowledge gap in many countries. Some hospitals do have advanced
					treatment systems yet lack the expertise required to use them to their full potential and with the
					highest safety.</p>

				<p>Radiotherapy is also a team sport. Besides radiation oncologists, we also need medical physicists and
					radiation therapists to treat patients. The Elekta Foundation is working with partners to deliver
					courses to improve their skills.</p>

				<p>Since the beginning of 2022, the foundation and the Turkish Radiation Society have co-organized
					hands-on workshops to improve radiation oncologists contouring skills in cervical cancer and breast
					cancer treatment.</p>

				<p>With Rayos Contra Cancer, we have funded several multi-course programs geared towards clinicians in
					low- and middle-income countries in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia. </p>
