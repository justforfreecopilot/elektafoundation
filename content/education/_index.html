				<h2>Training and Education in Radiotherapy</h2>

				<p>In radiotherapy, patient outcomes depend on how clinicians use their equipment and techniques. Unfortunately, there is a large knowledge gap in many countries. Some hospitals do have advanced treatment systems yet lack the expertise required to use them to their full potential and with the highest safety.</p>

				<p>Radiotherapy is also a team sport. Besides radiation oncologists, we also need medical physicists and radiation therapists to treat patients. The Elekta Foundation is working with partners to deliver courses to improve their skills.</p>

				<p>Since the beginning of 2022, the foundation and the Turkish Radiation Society have co-organized two hands-on workshops to improve radiation oncologists contouring skills in cervical cancer and breast cancer treatment.</p>

				<p>With Rayos Contra Cancer, we have funded several multi-course programs geared towards clinicians in low- and middle-income countries in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia. For example, recent courses have been delivered for medical physicists who are new to VMAT/IMRT* treatment in English and Spanish. More than 1000 participants registered to join this program.</p>
